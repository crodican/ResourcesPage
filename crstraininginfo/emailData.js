I see that you filled out our Recovery Specialist Interest Survey, which is a great first step! Checking out the PCB's schedule of upcoming trainings, you might be able to find a suitable class. For the trainings which are offered by PRO-ACT / The Council of Southeast Pennsylvania, you generally need to be a resident of (or be employed in) the county in which the training is being held, as the course is offered to you for free and funding is based on county. I am unsure if that is the case for some of the trainings offered by other organizations, but it may not hurt to reach out if there is one that you find to be suitable, and since the list is always being updated you should keep checking back.

First, let me congratulate you on your decision—it's an extremely rewarding way to use your lived experience to help others in recovery. I see that you've already filled out the RS Interest Survey , which is fantastic! This put you on a list, which goes in order of who filled out first. When we hold a Recovery Specialist class in a county, we go down the list and interview people until the class is full. Since you filled yours out back in April, it looks like we would be calling you for the next Recovery Specialist Training that PRO-ACT holds in Bucks County. PRO-ACT does not currently have a Bucks County training scheduled, however the Bucks County Drug and Alcohol Commission is offering a Recovery Specialist training in March at no cost. If you're interested, please reach out to Dr. Martha Thompson at drmartha@empowerthemind.org . You can find this information, and any other upcoming CRS classes, on the Pennsylvania Certification Board's constantly updated list of upcoming Recovery Specialist trainings: Recovery Specialist Classes | Pennsylvania Certification Board . If you haven't already, you should create an account to apply for courses directly through the site. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to email CRSTrainingInfo@councilsepa.org , and we will get back to you as soon as possible. Best regards and good luck!

Just wanted to send this email now before the start of the work week. I am interested in free CRS classes do to financial strain. I've read what the qualifications for a Certified Recovery Specialist are and I think it would be a great fit for me and I have over 5 years of sobriety. I do live outside of Philadelphia County in Bucks county. I Was Wondering if you had access to any information regarding free CRS training in Bucks County? When you can if you could please get back to me that would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy the rest of your weekend. Thank you Lindsay Gorgas Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone",

Becoming a Certified Recovery Specialist is such a rewarding way to use your lived experiences in recovery to help others. The steps to becoming certified are that you will take a 78 hour training course, after which you will be able to apply to take the CRS exam. The application includes a 1000 word essay, but as a 30 year teacher something tells me you'll do fine. As the requirement for enrollment in a CRS training is 18 months in a continuous manner of personal, lived, recovery experience including abstinence from alcohol and other substances, you are well on your way with one year, and there is a lot you can do in the meantime if you're looking to get started. So I can best assist you, may I ask what county you are in?

A CRS (Certified Recovery Specialist) certification is a credential for individuals with personal, lived experience in their own substance use disorder recovery, enabling them to work in a career where they use that lived experience to support, motivate and guide others into and through their own recovery.  To be eligible for a training, individuals must have a high school diploma or a GED, and at least eighteen months in a continuous manner of personal, lived, recovery experience, which includes abstinence from alcohol and other non-prescribed substances.  The training consists of 78 hours of mandatory, standardized recovery specialist training, which takes place over a period of ten eight-hour classes, over a two-week period or ten-week period, depending on if it is a weekly class or daily.  After taking the training, individuals will then complete the application online or apply by mail, email, or fax.  The application fee is $150 dollars, plus the cost of notarizing the application, which usually costs $25.  We hold several Recovery Specialists per year around Southeastern Pennsylvania, available to individuals who live or work within the county in which that training is being held.  We make these trainings available at no cost to the individual.  There are additional trainings offered by other organizations as well, some of which are also offered at no cost, and some are offered for as high as $1200 dollars.   So I can best assist you, can you please tell me what county your customer lives and/or works in?  If they have not already done so, if they are within the counties which we serve, Philadelphia, Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery and Schuylkill, please have them fill out this short form to be added to the list to be contacted when we are filling a training in their county:https://councilsepa.org/hubs/certifications/survey...",

These meetings are a key opportunity for Certified Peer Specialists (CPS) and Certified Recovery Specialists (CRS) to connect, collaborate, and advocate for our community.?? Philly Local Meetings: 2nd Tuesday of each month, 12:30–2:30 PM?? SE Regional Meetings: 1st Monday of each month, 3:00–5:00 PMWith recent shifts in behavioral health funding and ongoing threats to peer-delivered services, it's more critical than ever for CRS/CPS professionals to be actively involved in advocacy efforts. Many programs that support peer work are facing reductions or restructuring, and without our voices at the table, there's a real risk of losing the progress we've made in recovery-oriented, person-centered care.Your insight and lived experience are essential. As a CRS or CPS, you understand the value of peer support better than anyone—and your input can directly influence decisions around funding, service delivery, and system priorities. CSP is a platform where you can help make sure our community's needs are heard and met.If you have questions or would like to get more involved, please reach out to the CPS Coordinator, Marvin White, at marvin.white@rhd.org.

They may find themselves working with a caseload of individuals in the office or out in the community, or working in a hospital, connecting with individuals in crisis and helping them find the treatment they need, and there are several other roles and jobs that a CRS might find themselves working in. To become a Certified Recovery Specialist, someone must be a person with personal lived recovery experience ( and have at least 18 months in a continuous manner), and must have a high school diploma or a GED.

Our group was first an offshoot of Caron and more recently is also associated with Be A Part of the Conversation parent partnership program. I am very interested in this certification and am somewhat familiar with it. I have some possible conflicts I may or may not be able to work out in order to apply and attend. I am wondering how definite it is that this July opportunity will take place. Are you hoping for a certain number of attendees and do you think it is likely you will have enough for it to take place? Do you have plans to offer it again in the Fall with this Mon-Thur model rather than the Saturday model? Id appreciate any insight regarding the offering. Many thanks, Diane Hogan",

I saw that you have already filled out our Recovery Specialist Interest Survey form, and you both live and work in Bucks County.

Some of them are free, some are around $50, and there are some that are full price which is a lot higher. The list is kept up to date, so you can keep checking it regularly to see newly added trainings. If you see one you want to apply for, dont click the green Enroll button, because that is not the way to apply, it is for people who have already applied and been accepted.

We conduct several Recovery Specialist trainings across the region each year, which are made available at no cost to the student. These trainings are open to individuals who live or work in the county where the training is conducted, and sometimes open to individuals in other counties as well. We have a short Recovery Specialist Interest Survey form, and if you could please have them fill this out, we will get back to them when a training is available for them. https://councilsepa.org/hubs/certifications/survey Additionally, here is the list of Recovery Specialist trainings from the Pennsylvania Certification Board. The list is kept up to date, and includes locations, pricing, and contact information for the facilitators of every Recovery Specialist training across the state. If there is a flyer, its a good idea to read it. Some of the classes will let people sign up for them by clicking the green Enroll button, and make a PCB account if they have not already done so. Some of them require a password, and in those cases it is generally best to email the facilitator/instructor directly unless it says otherwise on the flyer. https://www.pacertboard.org/node/141627/classesBest of luck and reach out if I can help with anything else please!",

It is continually updated, so you can check it weekly or even daily if there isnt a close training you're interested in. It has the prices of the training, some are free or low cost, others are more expensive. If there is a flyer, make sure you read it before you apply. For some of the trainings, you can click the green \"Enroll\" button, you would need to create a PCB account if you have not already done so. If it won't let you use the enroll button for a course, it likely means you need to just email the instructor, but make sure you read the flyer if there is one for that couse.

The trainings are ten days long, and will generally be either two weeks of Monday to Friday or ten Saturdays, and theyre usually 9am to 5pm. If you could please complete this short form, it will put you on our list to be contacted when we are filling the next available suitable training for you: https://councilsepa.org/hubs/certifications/survey Also, here is the list of all upcoming Recovery Specialist trainings in the state. This list is updated every time a new training is added, and it includes not only the trainings offered by us, but those from other organizations. It includes the price, date and location, and contact information for the instructors. While there are no trainings inside Bucks county at the moment, depending on how far you can drive and your availability, there may be a training for you now, and if not, the list is continually updated so you should check it often: https://www.pacertboard.org/node/141627/classes If you are interested in any trainings you see on that list, read the flyer if there is one, and then contact the instructor. If its a PRO-ACT/Council of Southeast PA training, make sure youve filled out that survey form I linked to above and then email the instructor. I dont know your preferences and availability in terms of schedule and travel, but some of the trainings you might be interested in from that list include #359, a Mon-Fri class in Philadelphia, starting August 18, and #336, a Sat class in Reading that starts on October 11. The Reading class costs $50. I pasted the list below, but make sure you check the link as they are always updated. Good Luck!",

The trainings are ten days long, and will generally be either two weeks of Monday to Friday or ten Saturdays, and theyre usually 9am to 5pm. If you could please complete this short form, it will put you on our list to be contacted when we are filling the next available suitable training for you: https://councilsepa.org/hubs/certifications/survey Also, here is the list of all upcoming Recovery Specialist trainings in the state. This list is updated every time a new training is added, and it includes not only the trainings offered by us, but those from other organizations. It includes the price, date and location, and contact information for the instructors. While there are no trainings inside Bucks county at the moment, depending on how far you can drive and your availability, there may be a training for you now, and if not, the list is continually updated so you should check it often: https://www.pacertboard.org/node/141627/classes If you are interested in any trainings you see on that list, read the flyer if there is one, and then contact the instructor. If its a PRO-ACT/Council of Southeast PA training, make sure youve filled out that survey form I linked to above and then email the instructor. I dont know your preferences and availability in terms of schedule and travel, but some of the trainings you might be interested in from that list include #359, a Mon-Fri class in Philadelphia, starting August 18, and #336, a Sat class in Reading that starts on October 11. The Reading class costs $50. I pasted the list below, but make sure you check the link as they are always updated. Good Luck!",
