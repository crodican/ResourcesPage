The application includes a 1000 word essay, but as a 30 year teacher something tells me you ll do fine. As the requirement for enrollment in a CRS training is 18 months in a continuous manner of personal, lived, recovery experience including abstinence from alcohol and other substances, you are well on your way with one year, and there is a lot you can do in the meantime if you re looking to get started.

For individuals with lived experience in overcoming substance use disorder, becoming a Certified Recovery Specialist presents a remarkable opportunity to make a profound difference. This certification enables you to uniquely contribute to the recovery community by offering empathy, motivation, and support grounded in your personal journey. The CRS is not a sponsor, case manager, or a therapist, but we provide a distinct and necessary perspective as a role model, mentor, advocate, and motivator. As a CRS you would be illuminating the recovery process through the lens of your own success. If this sounds like what you are looking for, then so we can best assist you, can you tell me what counties you live in and work in? We hold several Recovery Specialist trainings in Southeast Pennsylvania a year, at no cost to the students, open to people who either live or work in the county that the training is held in. In order to get on our list to be contacted when we schedule a training in your county, please use the following link to complete our short Recovery Specialist Interest Survey. You'll be added to our list which is used to fill classes, so that when a training is available for you, we will contact you with the next steps: https://councilsepa.org/hubs/certifications/survey. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Certification Board keeps an updated list of all currently scheduled Recovery Specialist trainings across the state which you can periodically check at the following link, in case you see a suitable training offered by another organization. https://www.pacertboard.org/node/141627/classes.

They may find themselves working with a caseload of individuals in the office or out in the community, or working in a hospital, connecting with individuals in crisis and helping them find the treatment they need, and there are several other roles and jobs that a CRS might find themselves working in. To become a Certified Recovery Specialist, someone must be a person with personal lived recovery experience ( and have at least 18 months in a continuous manner), and must have a high school diploma or a GED. The training is 78 hours in total, 75 hours of class time and three hours' worth of homework. Our trainings are generally two weeks, Monday through Friday, or ten Saturdays.
