        "body": "Kristy,\n\nThank you for reaching out and congratulations on your recovery journey. For individuals with lived experience in overcoming substance use disorder, becoming a Certified Recovery Specialist presents a remarkable opportunity to make a profound difference. This certification enables you to uniquely contribute to the recovery community by offering empathy, motivation, and support grounded in your personal journey. The CRS is not a sponsor, case manager, or a therapist, but we provide a distinct and necessary perspective as a role model, mentor, advocate, and motivator. As a CRS you would be illuminating the recovery process through the lens of your own success. If this sounds like what you are looking for, then so we can best assist you, can you tell me what counties you live in and work in?\n\nWe hold several Recovery Specialist trainings in Southeast Pennsylvania a year, at no cost to the students, open to people who either live or work in the county that the training is held in. In order to get on our list to be contacted when we schedule a training in your county, please use the following link to complete our short Recovery Specialist Interest Survey. You'll be added to our list which is used to fill classes, so that when a training is available for you, we will contact you with the next steps:\n\nAdditionally, the Pennsylvania Certification Board keeps an updated list of all currently scheduled Recovery Specialist trainings across the state which you can periodically check at the following link, in case you see a suitable training offered by another organization.\n\nWe are here to assist you if you have any additional questions or need assistance, so don't hesitate to reach out at .\n\nBest of luck, Kristy!",

Designed specifically for providers and service teams, the session explores the distinction between natural peer support and certified peer roles, outlines the credentialing process for Certified Peer Specialists (CPS) and Certified Recovery Specialists (CRS), and highlights the benefits of peer services within clinical and community environments. Participants will gain a better understanding of how peer professionals support recovery, collaborate with other providers, and contribute to person-centered care.\nImportant Note:\nPlease be aware that this is not a CEU training.

They may find themselves working with a caseload of individuals in the office or out in the community, or working in a hospital, connecting with individuals in crisis and helping them find the treatment they need, and there are several other roles and jobs that a CRS might find themselves working in.\n\nTo become a Certified Recovery Specialist, someone must be a person with personal lived recovery experience (and have at least 18 months in a continuous manner), and must have a high school diploma or a GED. The training is 78 hours in total, 75 hours of class time and three hours' worth of homework. Our trainings are generally two weeks, Monday through Friday, or ten Saturdays.\n\nSo I can best assist you in locating a suitable training, can you tell me what counties you live in and work in?",

Becoming Certified Recovery Specialist is a fantastic opportunity to use your personal, lived recovery experience to assist individuals with their own recovery! We conduct several Recovery Specialist trainings across the region each year, available to individuals who live or work in the county where the training is being conducted. These trainings are offered at no cost to the students. I see that you've already filled out our Recovery Specialist Interest Survey form yesterday, which is great! We use the list generated from that form to contact people to fill the trainings, so as soon as a training becomes available for you, we will contact you with the next steps for enrolling.\n\nAdditionally, you can also check the Pennsylvania Certification Board website's statewide list of all upcoming Recovery Specialist trainings to see if another training is suitable for you in terms of cost and location. As the list is continually updated, you may want to check back regularly. If you see a course you want to apply for, it is best to contact the facilitator using the email provided in the list. It can be confusing, but the green \"Enroll\" button is actually for enrolling for the class portal.\n\nBest of luck!",
