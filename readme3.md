# NocoDB API Proxy Worker

A Cloudflare Worker that acts as a proxy API endpoint for a NocoDB database with enhanced filtering, sorting, and search
capabilities.

## Overview

This worker provides a customizable API layer between your frontend application and a NocoDB database. It handles
complex queries, pagination, and special sorting requirements while keeping your NocoDB API token secure.

## Features

-   ‚úÖ Filter records by multiple criteria
-   üîç Full-text search across multiple fields
-   üìÑ Page-based pagination
-   üß≠ Special handling for distance-based sorting (in development)
-   üîê Secure API token management
-   üåê CORS support for browser clients

### Response Format

#### Standard Response

```{
  "list": [...],
  "pageInfo": {
    "totalRows": 100,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageSize": 25
  }
}
```

#### Distance Sort Response (In Development)

```
{
  "list": [...],
  "pageInfo": {...},
  "distanceSorted": true
}
```

### Security

- All API tokens are stored securely in environment variables
- CORS headers allow any origin (should be restricted in production)
- Input validation prevents basic injection attacks

### Monitoring
Use Cloudflare's dashboard to monitor:

- Request rates
- Error rates
- Response times
- Bandwidth usage

## API Usage

You can access the data through your deployed Cloudflare Worker URL. The following query parameters are supported:

### Basic Parameters

* `page`: (Optional, integer, default: `1`) The page number for pagination.
* `limit`: (Optional, integer, default: `25`) The number of records to return per page.
* `sort`: (Optional, string) Specifies the field(s) to sort by. Prefix a field name with `-` for descending order (e.g., `sort=Name,-Date`). Ensure the field names match your NocoDB column names exactly.
* `fields`: (Optional, string) A comma-separated list of field names to include in the response. This can help reduce the data transferred.
* `recordId`: (Optional, string) If provided, fetches a single record with the specified ID. All other filtering and pagination parameters are ignored.
* `count`: (Optional, integer, value: `1`) If set to `1`, only returns the total count of records matching the applied filters. No actual record data is returned.
* `viewId`: (Optional, string) The ID of a specific NocoDB view to use for fetching data. If not provided, the default view ID (configured in the worker) will be used.

### Filtering Parameters

You can filter data based on specific column values. The parameter names correspond to your NocoDB column names.

* `County`: Filter by one or more county names. Multiple values can be provided by repeating the parameter (e.g., `?County=Berks&County=Bucks`) or as a comma-separated string (e.g., `?County=Berks,Bucks`).
* `Populations`: (Assuming your NocoDB column is named 'Populations Served') Filter by populations served. Supports multiple values similar to `County`. Uses a `like` operator for partial matches.
* `Resource Type`: Filter by one or more resource types. Supports multiple values similar to `County`.
* `Category`: Filter by one or more categories. Supports multiple values similar to `County`.
* `search`: (Optional, string) A general search term that will look for matches in the `'Location Name'`, `'Organization'`, and `'Category'` columns (configurable in the worker).

### Distance Sorting Parameters

You can sort resources based on their distance from a given latitude and longitude.

* `userLat`: (Required for distance sort, float) The user's latitude.
* `userLon`: (Required for distance sort, float) The user's longitude.
* `sort`: (Required for distance sort, string, value: `distance`) Set the `sort` parameter to `distance` to enable distance-based sorting.

**Important Note on Distance Sorting:** Due to limitations in NocoDB's sorting capabilities with dynamic calculations, distance sorting is handled within the Cloudflare Worker. This means:

* The worker fetches a limited number of records (currently 1000) that match the filters.
* The distance is calculated for each fetched record.
* The records are then sorted by distance within the worker.
* Pagination is applied to the sorted results.
* The `totalRows` in the `pageInfo` for distance-sorted results reflects the number of records fetched for distance calculation (up to the limit), not the absolute total number of filtered resources. For an accurate total count with distance filtering, a separate count query (without distance parameters) would be needed.

## Examples

### Fetching the first page of resources (default limit of 25):
https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/


### Fetching page 3 with a limit of 10:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?page=3&amp;limit=10


### Sorting resources by name in ascending order:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?sort=Location Name


### Sorting resources by date in descending order and then by name in ascending order:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?sort=-Date,Location Name


### Filtering resources in "Berks" and "Bucks" counties:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?County=Berks&amp;County=Bucks


### Filtering resources with a "Warm Handoff" category:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?Category=Warm%20Handoff


### Fetching only the "Location Name" and "Organization" fields:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?fields=Location Name,Organization


### Fetching a single record with ID "rec1234567890":

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?recordId=rec1234567890


### Getting the total count of resources in "Philadelphia" county:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?County=Philadelphia&amp;count=1


### Fetching resources sorted by distance from latitude 40.0 and longitude -75.0:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?userLat=40.0&amp;userLon=-75.0&amp;sort=distance


### Fetching the second page of resources sorted by distance:

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?userLat=40.0&amp;userLon=-75.0&amp;sort=distance&amp;page=2&amp;limit=15


### Filtering by county and searching for "clinic":

https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?County=Montgomery&amp;search=clinic


## Response Format

The API generally returns a JSON object with the following structure (unless `count=1` or `recordId` is used):

```json
{
  "list": [
    {
      "id": "recxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "fields": {
        "Location Name": "...",
        "Organization": "...",
        "Category": "...",
        // ... other fields based on your NocoDB table and the 'fields' parameter
        "Latitude": 40.0,
        "Longitude": -75.0,
        "distance": 12.34 // Only present when distance sorting is applied
      },
      "createdAt": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z"
    },
    // ... more records
  ],
  "pageInfo": {
    "totalRows": 150,
    "isFirstPage": true,
    "isLastPage": false,
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageSize": 25
  }
}

```

When fetching a single record (recordId is provided), the response will be a single JSON object representing that record:

### JSON
```
{
  "id": "recxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "fields": {
    "Location Name": "...",
    "Organization": "...",
    // ... all fields for the record
    "Latitude": 40.0,
    "Longitude": -75.0
  },
  "createdAt": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-10-27T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

When requesting a count (count=1), the response will be:

### JSON
```
{
  "count": 78
}
```

## CORS Headers
The worker includes basic CORS headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*', Access-Control-Allow-Methods: 'GET, OPTIONS', Access-Control-Allow-Headers: '*'). You may want to adjust these in production for better security by specifying allowed origins and headers.
