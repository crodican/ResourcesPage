# Resource Database API

This document describes how to interact with the Resource Database API hosted on Cloudflare Workers.

**API Endpoint:** `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/`

This API allows you to retrieve and filter resource information, with support for pagination, enhanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities.

This endpoint can serve as a customizable API layer between your frontend application and a NocoDB database. It efficiently handles complex queries, pagination, and specific sorting requirements while ensuring the security of your NocoDB API token.

## Features

* ‚úÖ **Filtering:** Filter records based on multiple criteria.
* üîç **Full-text Search:** Perform searches across multiple fields.
* üìÑ **Pagination:** Implement page-based navigation of results.
* üß≠ **Distance-Based Sorting (In Development):** Special handling for sorting records by distance.
* üîê **Secure Token Management:** Keeps your NocoDB API token confidential.
* üåê **CORS Support:** Enables access from browser clients.

## Usage

All requests should be made to the base API endpoint. Parameters are passed as URL query strings.

### Limiting Total Rows / Pagination

The API uses `page` and `limit` parameters for pagination.

* **`limit`**: Controls the number of rows (records) to display per page.
    * **To show `x` number of rows per page:** Use the `limit` query parameter.
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?limit=10` (shows 10 rows per page)
* **`page`**: Specifies which page of results to retrieve.
    * **To view a specific page:** Use the `page` query parameter in conjunction with `limit`.
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?limit=5&page=2` (shows 5 rows, from the second page of results)

### Filtering by Facets and Taxonomies

You can filter the results using various parameters corresponding to the available facets and taxonomies. For filters that allow multiple selections (e.g., `County`), you can repeat the parameter in the URL.

### API Parameters

The following parameters can be used to query the API:

#### Filter Options:

* **`County`**: Filters resources by one or more counties.
    * **Options:** Philadelphia, Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery, Schuylkill
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?County=Philadelphia`
    * Example (multiple counties): `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?County=Philadelphia&County=Delaware`

* **`Populations`** (`Populations Served` in the backend): Filters resources by populations served.
    * **Options:** Men, Women, Children, Adolescents
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?Populations=Men`
    * Example (multiple populations): `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?Populations=Men&Populations=Children`

* **`Resource Type`**: Filters resources by their type.
    * **Options:** Recovery Support, Family Support, Housing, Transportation
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?Resource%20Type=Housing` (Note: Spaces in parameter names must be URL-encoded as `%20`)

### Combining Filters

You can combine any of the above filter parameters to narrow down your search results.

* Example: Get the first 5 "Housing" resources for "Philadelphia" county that serve "Men".
    `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?limit=5&Resource%20Type=Housing&County=Philadelphia&Populations=Men`

### Sorting

* **`sort`**: Sorts the results.
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?sort=Location%20Name` (sorts by Location Name)
    * The worker code also indicates experimental support for `sort=distance` if `userLat` and `userLon` are provided, though this appears to be under development in the provided code snippet.

### Fetching a Single Record

* **`recordId`**: Retrieves a single record by its unique ID.
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?recordId=someUniqueId123`
* **`fields`**: When fetching a single record or a list, you can specify which fields to return, separated by commas.
    * Example: `https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?recordId=someUniqueId123&fields=Location%20Name,Full%20Address`

## Examples

### Basic Examples

- Fetching the first page of resources (default limit of 25):

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/`

- Fetching page 3 with a limit of 10:

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?page=3&limit=10`

- Sorting resources by name in ascending order:

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?sort=Location%20Name`

- Sorting resources by date in descending order and then by name in ascending order:

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?sort=-Date,Location%20Name`

- Fetching only the "Location Name" and "Organization" fields:

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?fields=Location%20Name,Organization`

Fetching a single record with ID "rec1234567890":

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?recordId=rec1234567890`

- Getting the total count of all resources:

`https://resourcesdatabaseproxy.crodican.workers.dev/?count=1`
