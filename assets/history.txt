In 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs (DDAP) began a significant push to reshape the state's approach to helping individuals in recovery from substance use disorder. Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all model was not meeting the diverse needs of individuals across the commonwealth, DDAP's 2019-2023 State Plan strongly emphasized and formalized the Recovery-Oriented System of Care, or ROSC. This system is a coordinated network of community-based services and supports that is person-centered, with the ultimate goal of improving the health, wellness, and quality of life for individuals in recovery from substance use disorder.  Emphasizing person-centered, strengths-based recovery, Recovery Oriented Systems of Care advocate for localized approaches that focus on individual strengths rather than uniform treatment. As Dr. Latika Davis-Jones, Secretary of DDAP, stated, “Recovery needs may not be same in Altoona as they are in Allentown.”

Building on this, in January 2021, DDAP launched Recovery Rising, an initiative to enhance and make recovery more inclusive across the state. The initiative's goal is to develop a system that provides diverse recovery options, promotes equitable treatment, and enhances community awareness, essentially making it easier for people to find their own path to wellness and feel empowered in their recovery journey. As outlined in the Recovery Rising Phase 2 report, a key strategy to achieve this was the creation of Regional Recovery Hubs, designed to support and enhance coordinated, community-based services and supports.  The program seeks to simplify the process for individuals to find their unique path to wellness and feel empowered throughout their recovery journey.

To make things as fair and flexible as possible, the team looked at how best to divide Pennsylvania into smaller regions, looking at population factors as well as needs, capacity, and existing resources of communities across the state.  Mapping over 300 recovery service providers, including recovery homes, community centers, and RCOs, the team ultimately decided to use the existing regional boundaries from the Bureau of Community Health.  These included nine regions, six of them based on geographic direction and three for the major cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Erie.

After careful consideration, DDAP selected the organizations and entities which would establish and administer each of the Regional Recovery Hubs.  PRO-ACT/The Council of Southeast Pennsylvania was honored to be entrusted to establish and administer the Region 1 and Region 4 Recovery Hubs. Region 1 serves Philadelphia, while Region 4 covers Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery, and Schuylkill counties.

Unity Recovery was selected for Region 2, serving Allegheny County, and The County of Erie Office of Drug & Alcohol Abuse for Region 3, serving Erie County.  The Pennsylvania Mental Health Consumers Association was selected for Region 5, which includes Adams, Bedford, Blair, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lebanon, Mifflin, Perry, and York counties. Armstrong Indiana Clarion Drug and Alcohol Commission was chosen for Regions 6 and 7, with Region 6 serving Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland counties, and Region 7 serving Cameron, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Forest, Jefferson, Lawrence, McKean, Mercer, Venango, and Warren counties. DDAP selected West Branch Drug and Alcohol Commission for Region 8, which serves Bradford, Centre, Clinton, Columbia, Lycoming, Montour, Northumberland, Potter, Snyder, Sullivan, Tioga, and Union counties and Northbound & Co was chosen for Region 9, serving Susquehanna, Wayne, Wyoming, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Carbon, Monroe, Pike, Lehigh, and Northampton counties.

With the organizations carefully selected, they got to work identifying and meeting the needs of their populations.  Each hub uses a “hub and spoke” model to provide recovery supports in their designated region. They support community-driven services in their respective regions which serve as the “spokes.”  

We are here to embed, expand, and promote the Recovery-Oriented System of Care. The hubs provide technical assistance and collaborate with a variety of community entities, sectors, and systems to enhance a recovery-supportive community and facilitate recovery support service delivery.

Project staff have engaged in a community needs assessment, a strategic planning process, and provide training and technical assistance aimed at growing and supporting a peer workforce, enhancing a community’s recovery orientation, and reducing stigma.
