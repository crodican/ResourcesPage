I have a database of resources, and need help to make a website for the displaying, sorting, filtering, and searching of them.  It should have a search bar at the top with a search button to the right, live search results updating with each key press is not necessary or desired as it would require many api calls, but pressing enter or the search button should filter the resources for the term that was typed.  there should be a chips area below the search bar displaying chips for any filters that are applied from either a search term, or from checkbox filters.  below this should be a filters area, a row with four columns, each containing an h4 header and checkbox filters..  the filters, in order, are:-COUNTIES: The options should be Philadelphia, Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery, and Schuylkill -POPULATIONS: The options should be Men, Women, Children, and Adolescents -RESOURCE TYPES: The options should be Recovery Support, Family Support, Housing, and Transportation -CATEGORIES:  The categories are Single County Authority, Center of Excellence, Regional Recovery Hub, Recovery Community Organization, Warm Handoff, Treatment with RSS,  Family Counseling, Family Peer Support, Family Assistance, Program, Family Education Program, Family Resources, Recovery House,  Halfway House, Housing Assistance, Affordable Public Transportation, Carpool Service, Medical Assistance Transportation,  Recovery Transportation Services, and Vehicle Purchase Assistance, Government, and Other. The options should be initially each set to display none, and then when the appropriate Resource Type is selected,  the categories of that type should be displayed:  Recovery Support (Single County Authority, Center of Excellence, Regional Recovery Hub,  Recovery Community Organization, Warm Handoff, and Treatment with RSS), Family Support (Family Counseling, Family Peer Support, Family Assistance  Program, Family Education Program, and Family Resources), Housing (Recovery House, Halfway House, and Housing Assistance), and Transportation (Affordable Public  Transportation, Carpool Service, Medical Assistance Transportation, Recovery Transportation Services, and  Vehicle Purchase Assistance), and if any one of the four Resource Types are selected, the two additional categories to show are Government  and Other.Below this should be a flex row, set to justify start with a div with id of 'counter', containing a "Results 1-25 of X" Counter, with an h4  heading class applied, on the left.  This should be updated depending on how many results are currently on the page and how many results there are with the applied parameters.    Just below this should be a flex row set to justify end, should be a div with an id of 'sort'.  This should contain on the same line, an h6 heading saying 'Sort By:' and a dropdown menu to sort by Relevance, Alphabetical and Distance.   The results should be displayed as the cards in a single column or list, not a grid, with pagination to show only 25 show at a time with a load more button at the bottom to load more.  The api i provide will do all the heavy lifting on the sorting, filtering, pagination, etc...  i will provide a readme...    The cards need to each contain the Location Name at the top, the organization below that, the resource type.   The resource type and the other three filterable facets, of category, populations served and county, should be displayed on the cards in the form of buttons or badge components, one for each value which that resource has... which when clicked, that facet value should then be added to the applied filters, resulting in an additional filter chip showing...  at the bottom of the page below the cards should be a "Load More" button, pressing should display an additional 25 more resources, and the counter above the results section should be updated to reflect the new number of resources displayed.
Here is the readme for my API endpoint app, which will do the heavy lifting:

# Hub Resources Application

The **Hub Resources Application** is a web application that allows users to search, filter, and sort through various Recovery resources in Regions 1 and 4 efficiently. It leverages a backend API powered by **NocoDB** to provide flexible querying and dynamic filtering capabilities.

---

## **Overview**
The Regions 1 and 4 Recovery Hubs database of resources contains resources of the following types: Recovery Support, Family Support, Housing, and Transportation, further separated into categories, across the eight counties served:  Philadelphia (Region 1), and Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery, and Schuylkill Counties (Region 4).

The resources database has the following attributes, or columns, if you will:
ID,	LOCATION NAME,	ORGANIZATION,	COUNTY,	RESOURCE TYPE,	CATEGORY,	POPULATIONS SERVED,	MORE INFO,	PHONE,	ADDRESS,	CITY,	STATE,	ZIP CODE,	WEBSITE,	IMAGE,	LATITUDE,	LONGITUDE,	PHONE URL,	FULL ADDRESS,	and GOOGLE MAPS URL.  Of these, COUNTY,	RESOURCE TYPE,	CATEGORY,	and POPULATIONS SERVED and the filterable facets on our web app. 


## **Features**
- Search resources by name, organization, or category.
- Filter resources based on:
  - County
  - Population Served
  - Resource Type
  - Category
- Sort resources by any field (e.g., County, Organization, etc.).
- Paginate through the results for better navigation.
- Retrieve a specific resource by its ID.

## **Developer Notes**

### **NocoDB Integration**
This app uses the NocoDB API to:
- Fetch records from the database.
- Apply filters dynamically using the `where` parameter.
- Perform searches using the `ilike` operator for case-insensitivity.
- Sort results based on specified fields.

### **Handling Case Sensitivity and Spaces**
- **Case Sensitivity**: Filters and searches use the `ilike` operator for case-insensitivity.
- **Spaces**: Spaces in query parameters are automatically URL-encoded (e.g., `Warm Handoff` becomes `Warm%20Handoff`).
