I need help to develop a bootstrap css html web page that allows the searching, filtering and displaying of a collection of resources from a TSV file, 
in custom bootstrap cards.

I have a template for the resource cards. I need to display info from a tsv on my page using javascript and use the card template for 
each of the resources.  The tsv contains the following columns: ID, LOCATION NAME, ORGANIZATION, COUNTY, RESOURCE TYPE, CATEGORY, 
POPULATIONS, MORE INFO, PHONE,  ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP CODE, WEBSITE, IMAGE, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, PHONE URL, FULL ADDRESS, and 
GOOGLE MAPS URL.  Of those columns, COUNTY, RESOURCE TYPE, CATEGORY, and POPULATIONS are the facets which will be used for filtering.
The rest are the attributes.

There are about 300 resources. 

I need to use javascript to search and filter the cards. I would like to use fuse.js 6.6.2 from cdnjs, bootstrap 5.3 css and js from 
cdnjs, and any other cdn you think we may need to best and most efficiently complete this project...

The page should have the following structure:

A search bar at the top ( need the cards to update as info is typed into the search bar, and if enter is pressed or the search button 
clicked, the text from the box clears, and the searched term becomes a chip in the chips area below the search bar). 
Additionally, i would like CTRL+K to automatically focus the search bar. I would like the placeholder text to say 
"Click Here or CTRL + K to Search".

Below the search bar an area for chips for any of the filters applied ( I would like a chip created for the search terms after 
enter is pressed or after a filter is checked in the checkbox filters).

Below the chip area should be the following checkbox filters in the filters area:

-Counties (The options should be Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery, and Schuylkill)

-Populations (The options should be Men, Women, Children, and Adolescents)

-Resource Types (The options should be Recovery Support, Family Support, Housing, and Transportation)

-Categories (The options should be dynamic depending on the resource type that is selected. If Recovery Support is selected, the, the
options should be Single County Authority, Center of Excellence, Regional Recovery Hub, Recovery Community Organization, Warm Handoff, 
and Treatment with RSS. if Family Support is selected the options should be Family Counseling, Family Peer Support, Family Assistance 
Program, Family Education Program, and Family Resources. If Housing is the selected Resource Type then the categories shown should be 
Recovery House, Halfway House, and Housing Assistance. If Transportation is selected, the categories shown should be Affordable Public 
Transportation, Carpool Service, Medical Assistance Transportation,

Recovery Transportation Services, and Vehicle Purchase Assistance. Additionally, the categories of Government and Other should be shown no matter which Resource Type is selected. Finally, if no Resource Type is selected, All of them should be shown.



Below this should be the results area. The results should be displayed as the cards from the format I am about to share, in a list 
format, with pagination so only 25 show at a time, with a load more button at the bottom to load more. There should be a "Results 1-25 
of X" Counter at the top, which would change to "1-50 of x" and so forth as well as a Sort By drop down to sort by Relevance or 
Alphabetical.

The Card Format Template is shown below.  There is a row element containing two cols, a sidenav, which contains a link for
WEBSITE, PHONE URL, and GOOGLE MAPS URL, then the card body.  This contains the LOCATION NAME, then the ORGANIZATION.  Then bootstrap
badges to show the RESOURCE TYPE and the CATEGORY.   Next is the ADDRESS followed by CITY, STATE, and ZIP CODE.  Then there is the 
place for POPULATION and then for COUNTY, each of which are bootstrap badges.  If there are more than one values for a facet, such
as a resource with POPULATIONS of Men, Women, and Children, there should be a bootstrap badge for each of them.  All of the 
bootstrap badges on the card should be clickable so that if clicked on, a filter chip is added to filter the resources by that facet.

Card Template:

The rest of the needed css should be in the cdn links.  please just try to use bootstrap classes
wherever possible.
