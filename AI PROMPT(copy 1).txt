I need help to develop a bootstrap css html web page that allows the searching, filtering and displaying of a collection of resources from a NocoDB
database, in custom bootstrap cards.

I have a template for the resource cards. My database contains the following columns: ID, LOCATION NAME, ORGANIZATION, COUNTY, RESOURCE TYPE, CATEGORY, 
POPULATIONS, MORE INFO, PHONE,  ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP CODE, WEBSITE, IMAGE, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, PHONE URL, FULL ADDRESS, and 
GOOGLE MAPS URL.  Of those columns, COUNTY, RESOURCE TYPE, CATEGORY, and POPULATIONS are the facets which will be used for filtering.
The rest are the attributes.

There are about 300 resources. 

I need a page to search and filter the resources and display them as bootstrap cards. 

The page should have the following structure:  

Body font is Oxygen, except all headers which are Lora.  Google fonts will suffice.
We will also need bootstrap icons for the page.

A search bar at the top ( need the cards to update as info is typed into the search bar, and if enter is pressed or the search button 
clicked, the text from the box clears, and the searched term becomes a chip in the chips area below the search bar). 
Additionally, i would like CTRL+K to automatically focus the search bar. I would like the placeholder text to say 
"Click Here or CTRL + K to Search".  The search bar should be a bootstrap input group,
with the following template:

                <div class="input-group">             
                    <input type="text" id="search-input"  class="form-control border-0 bg-gray-subtle py-0 px-4" placeholder="Search resources...">
                    <div class="input-group-append kbd">
                        <div class="bg-gray-subtle px-2 py-1 d-flex" style="height: 100%">
                            <span><kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd></span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="input-group-append">
                        <button class="btn customButton--secondary py-1 px-3 searchButton" type="button"
                            style="border-radius: 1px 10px 10px 1px !important">
                            <span class="bi bi-search"></span>
                        </button>
                    </div>
                </div>

Below the search bar an area for chips for any of the filters applied ( I would like a chip created for the search terms after 
enter is pressed or after a filter is checked in the checkbox filters).  These chips should 
look like or use the bootstrap badge class, with a bg color of #f5ebf3 and a text color of
#000.

Below the chip area should be the filters area, in a bootstrap row, with an H2 heading that says 'Filters', with a toggle to display the 
four Facets below, each of which should be in a column set to "col-lg-3 col-md-3 
col-sm-10".  Each column should have an H5 heading, and below that should be the checkbox filters, using bootstrap's form-check, 
form-check-imput, and form-check-label classes.

-COUNTIES: The options should be Philadelphia, Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lancaster, Montgomery, and Schuylkill

-POPULATIONS: The options should be Men, Women, Children, and Adolescents

-RESOURCE TYPES: The options should be Recovery Support, Family Support, Housing, and Transportation

-CATEGORIES:  The categories are Single County Authority, Center of Excellence, Regional Recovery Hub, Recovery Community Organization, Warm Handoff, Treatment with RSS, 
Family Counseling, Family Peer Support, Family Assistance, Program, Family Education Program, Family Resources, Recovery House, 
Halfway House, Housing Assistance, Affordable Public Transportation, Carpool Service, Medical Assistance Transportation, 
Recovery Transportation Services, and Vehicle Purchase Assistance, Government, and Other.

The options should be initially each set to display none, and then when the appropriate Resource Type is selected, 
the categories of that type should be displayed:  Recovery Support (Single County Authority, Center of Excellence, Regional Recovery Hub, 
Recovery Community Organization, Warm Handoff, and Treatment with RSS), Family Support (Family Counseling, Family Peer Support, Family Assistance 
Program, Family Education Program, and Family Resources), Housing (Recovery House, Halfway House, and Housing Assistance), and Transportation (Affordable Public 
Transportation, Carpool Service, Medical Assistance Transportation, Recovery Transportation Services, and 
Vehicle Purchase Assistance), and if any one of the four Resource Types are selected, the two additional categories to show are Government 
and Other.

Below this should be a flex row, set to justify start with a div with id of 'counter', containing a "Results 1-25 of X" Counter, with an h4 
heading class applied, on the left.  This should be updated depending on how many results are currently on the page and how many results there
are with the applied parameters.  Just below this should be a flex row set to justify end, should be a div with an id of 'sort'.  This should contain
on the same line, an h6 heading saying 'Sort By:' and a dropdown menu to sort by Relevance, Alphabetical and Distance.  


The results should be displayed as the cards in a flex-column, with pagination to show only 25 show at a time
with a load more button at the bottom to load more.

The Card Format Template is described below.

The card should have bootstrap classes 'shadow-lg text-bg-white'.
Inside should be a row element with classes ''row no-gutters p-0'' containing two cols, one is the sidenav, 
which contains links for WEBSITE, PHONE URL, and GOOGLE MAPS URL, using bootstrap icons.

The other col is the card body.  

The card sidenav should have the bootstrap classes 'bg-secondary col-2 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center p-0'.
It should contain three <a> link elements with classes of 'd-flex align-items-center justify-content-center 
flex-grow-1 w-100 text-white', one for WEBSITE which uses the URL from the WEBSITE column, and displays 'bi bi-globe',
one for the phone number which uses the url from PHONE URL, and one for directions which uses the 'bi bi-geo-alt-fill'
for the icon.

The card body should have the bootstrap classes 'col-10 p-4'.
It should have an h3 with class of 'text-secondary' for the LOCATION NAME, h5 with the ORGANIZATION below that,
and then bootstrap badges for the facet values for the RESOURCE TYPE and CATEGORIES.  On the next line down should be 
an h6 with the word "Phone:" and then the value for PHONE, and below that a <br /> to skip a line,
and then <p> element, with <span> for ADDRESS, and on the next line spans for CITY, a comma, STATE, a comma, and then 
ZIP CODE.  Below that should be an h6 saying "Populations Served:" and bootstrap badges for the values of the POPULATIONS
facet.  Below that should be an h6 saying "County:" and bootstrap badges for the values of the COUNTY
facet.  Each of the bootstrap badges containing facet values should be clickable, and if clicked, that facet value should
be added as a filter with a filter chip shown in the chip area.



The card should have the bootstrap classes 
'shadow-lg text-bg-white', inside of which is a div 'row no-gutters p-0', and then the card sidenav and card body.
The card sidenav should have classes 'col-2 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center p-0'.
Inside the card sidenav are the links for WEBSITE, PHONE URL, and GOOGLE MAPS URL, taken from the database columns.
They should have the classes of 'd-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-grow-1 w-100 text-white'.
They will use the bootstrap icons bi-globe, bi-telephone-fill, and bi-geo-alt-fill.

The Card body should have 'col-10 p-4'.
This contains the LOCATION NAME, then the ORGANIZATION.  Then bootstrap
badges to show the RESOURCE TYPE and the CATEGORY.   Next is the ADDRESS followed by CITY, STATE, and ZIP CODE.  Then there is the 
place for POPULATION and then for COUNTY, each of which are bootstrap badges.  If there are more than one values for a facet, such
as a resource with POPULATIONS of Men, Women, and Children, there should be a bootstrap badge for each of them.  All of the 
bootstrap badges on the card should be clickable so that if clicked on, a filter chip is added to filter the resources by that facet.

Additionally, there needs to be the IMAGE, the url is the url value in the IMAGE column of the database.

Card Template should be something like:

                    <div class="resourceCard shadow-lg text-bg-white br-5-5-5-5 mb-5">
                        <div class="row no-gutters p-0">
                            <div class="card-sidenav col-2 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between align-items-center p-0">
                                <a href="WEBSITE" class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-grow-1 w-100 text-white"> <i class="bi bi-globe"></i> </a>
                                <a href="PHONE URL" class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-grow-1 w-100 text-white"> <i class="bi bi-telephone-fill"></i> </a>
                                <a href="GOOGLE MAPS URL" class="d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center flex-grow-1 w-100 text-white"> <i class="bi bi-geo-alt-fill"></i> </a>
                            </div>
                            <div class="card-body col-10 p-4">

                                <div class="row">

                                    </div>
                                    <div class="col d-flex justify-content-end align-items-end"> <img class="cardImage" src="IMAGE" alt="Logo"> </div>

                    </div>v>
                </div>
